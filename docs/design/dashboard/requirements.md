## Functional Requirements

1. **User Authentication**:
   - A secure authentication mechanism that supports multiple user roles (Admin,
     Editor, Tournament Organizer, Competitive Player).
   - A session management system to maintain a user's active session after login
     and automatically log out users after prolonged inactivity.

1. **User Management**:
   - A user management interface for admins to add, modify, or remove users and
     adjust their permissions.

     and other relevant content.

     review.

     suggestion to review.

1. **Data Archival & Deletion**:
   - Mechanisms to soft-delete data, making it invisible to regular users but
     retrievable if necessary.

     accessible storage, ensuring the main dashboard remains fast and
     uncluttered.

     or web scraping techniques.
   - Settings or configurations to dictate how frequently this aggregation
     occurs.
